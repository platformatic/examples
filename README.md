### [How to migrate a Fastify app to Platformatic Service](https://blog.platformatic.dev/how-to-migrate-a-fastify-app-to-platformatic-service)

<a href="https://blog.platformatic.dev/how-to-migrate-a-fastify-app-to-platformatic-service"><img src="https://hashnode.com/utility/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.hashnode.com%2Fres%2Fhashnode%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1685388617517%2Fb1236004-894d-4302-adef-70b87466f9ab.png%3Fw%3D1200%26auto%3Dformat%26format%3Dwebp%26fm%3Dpng" width="500"></a>

*Uses: Fastify, Platformatic Service*

> [Platformatic Service](https://oss.platformatic.dev/docs/reference/service/introduction) is the natural evolution of the build-it-from-scratch Fastify development experience. It provides a solid foundation for building Node.js applications on top of Fastify, with best practices baked in.
>
> The good news is that the path to migrate a Fastify application to use Platformatic Service is fairly straightforward. This guide covers some of the things you'll need to know when migrating an application, as well as tips on different migration approaches.

### [How to deploy an Express app to Platformatic Cloud](https://blog.platformatic.dev/how-to-deploy-an-express-application-to-platformatic-cloud)

<a href="https://blog.platformatic.dev/how-to-deploy-an-express-application-to-platformatic-cloud"><img src="https://hashnode.com/utility/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.hashnode.com%2Fres%2Fhashnode%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1686685153803%2F8a87b92e-84ac-4c14-a910-f4af38596bd4.png%3Fw%3D1200%26auto%3Dformat%26format%3Dwebp%26fm%3Dpng" width="500"></a>

*Uses: Express, Fastify, Platformatic Service*

> If you have an existing [Express](http://expressjs.com/) application, migrating it to Fastify could potentially be time consuming, and might not be something that you're able to prioritise right now. You can however still take advantage of Fastify, as well as our open-source tools and Cloud hosting service. In this guide you'll learn how to use the [`@fastify/express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fastify/express) plugin to help you rapidly migrate your existing Express application to use Platformatic Service, and then deploy it to Platformatic Cloud.
